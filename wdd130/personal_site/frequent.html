                    Begin with the easiest solution. With networking, this is checking to make sure the network cable is properly connected to both the computer and the network port on the wall. If you do not see a blinking light on your network card, chances are the physical connection to the network may be the problem. Double check those cables.
                    If you are in a room that has more than one network port, try connecting using a different port. If that works, then the network port may be the problem. You should let your tech specialist or network administrator know that there is a bad port in your room.
                    If you are on a wireless network, moving your computer may cause you to fall out of the range of the wireless access point. Try moving your computer to a different location to see if you regain connectivity.

                        Check the recycle bin If you are using a Windows computer, there are a few different ways to try to recover your deleted files. First, you can check the Recycle Bin. The Recycle Bin is a temporary storage location for files that have been deleted from your computer. If the file you are looking for is in the Recycle Bin, you can restore it by right-clicking on the file and selecting Restore.
                        If the file you are looking for is not in the Recycle Bin, do not worry, there are still some things you can try. One option is to use a data recovery software program. These programs can often undelete files that have been accidentally deleted. There are many different data recovery programs available, so you may want to research the best one for you. Popular tools include Recuva and EaseUS.

                        What do I do when my computer crashes?

                        If your computer crashes, the first thing you should do is try to restart it. If that does not work, you can try a few different things to troubleshoot the issue.
                        One common cause of crashes is an overheated CPU, so you will want to check and make sure that all of your fans are functioning properly and that there is no dust blocking any of the vents.
                        Another possibility is that your RAM is faulty or overloaded, so you can try removing and reinstalling it.
                        If your computer is still having issues, it is possible that there is a problem with the hard drive. In this case, you can try running a disk check or drive scan to see if there are any errors that need to be fixed.
                        If all else fails, you may need to reinstall your operating system. This can be a time-consuming process, but it is often the only way to fix a severely damaged system.

                        With a little effort, you should be able to get your computer up and running again in no time.
